    <hr>
    <p>Hello ,GRIZZüêª<br>
        I hope this message finds you well! I am writing to invite you to a casual meet-up this Thursday. <br>
        Let's gather at the metro station at 6:30 PM. It will be a great chance to catch up and enjoy some time together as we explore the nearby areas. <br>
        Please let me know if you can make it, so we can look forward to a fun and relaxing evening together. <br>
        Looking forward to your response! <br>
        Your lil' bro<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0&ab_channel=SimpiCreeper">üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è</a></p>
